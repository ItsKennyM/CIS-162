    <h1>Why i travel.</h1>
    <p>It has always been my dream to see the world, and i know that i need money to see all the things i want to see. I want to visit all the states in america, then all countires in eourope, then hopefully take a step in every continent.</p>
<h1>How i travel</h1>
<p>For now the only way i travel is by car. I have a simple Nissan Versa S+ from 2018 that has MPG. Plane tickets are too much for me to buy right now but that is the next step towards my goals</p>
