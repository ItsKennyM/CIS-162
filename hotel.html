<h2>Double Tree by Hilton</h2>
    <p>Easy to book and stay!</p>
    <p>One of the nicest places ive stayed early on. I was new to renting hotels and hilton became one of my favorites. Relaible brand name and decent prices. What really made me pick hilton was the fact that you did not to have to be 21 to rent the hotel. </p>

<h2>Hilton Garden Inn</h2>
    <p>Good Location for going out</p>
    <p>I was 21 when i booked this place(only need to be 18). This hotel is located in downtown burbank. Being new to the area i didnt know where to go but it was nice to see that everything was in walking distance and was a very walkable city. At night many bars and other places opened up so its great for a simple yet eventfull nighttime event! </p>

<h2>Hampton Inn</h2>
    <p>Wonderful quality and good for staying in</p>
    <p>Theres not much to do at this hotel. Not much around it, close to an ikea i guess but regardless that wasnt why i went. I just wanted to get out of my house for a while and have some personal time, with my AC broken in summer heats i decided to save a bit and book a place to relax. The quality of the room was super nice and luckily there are alot of nice restaurants around!</p>

<h2>The Grand HYATT</h2>
    <p>EXPENSIVE</p>
    <p>The total cost for staying 3 nights was over $2000. Crazy expensive it was extremely nice and a wonderful location but yet i wouldnt do it again. Even tho i stayed for free the stay is not worth the cost. Unfortunetly i went during a HUGE event and they were packed in! so the traffic was horrible but the views were amazing. i got to see the ocean and the city from one room!</p>
